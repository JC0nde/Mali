here lies the code for my future personal [website](https://jonathanconde.com).

## building
requires `composer` and `npm`
  
```
git clone https://github.com/JC0nde/site.git
cd site 
composer install
npm install
```
don't forget to change your `.env` file
and then run `php artisan serve` and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

For front-end developement run `npm run watch`
